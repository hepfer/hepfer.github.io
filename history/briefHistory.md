## Brief History

The origin of the HEPFER name was believed to have came from "Hopfen Baur" which translated into English as "Hops Farmer."  This is a farmer who grows hops which are used in the making of beer in southern Germany.  In the research, the Hepfer name was found in Wiesbaden, Germany, as a HEPFER migrated to Willowdale, Ontario, Canada in 1974.  A group of the HEPFER clan has been found living around Lake Constance in Southern Germany as farmers.  Some of the relatives of the Wiesbaden HEPFER family resided in and around Frankfort as of 1988.

A Daniel HEPFER was found in Pennsylvania.  He was born in 1806 in Pennsylvania.  He married Rebecca FOX and they too were farmers.  Daniel's parents arrived 10 to 15 years earlier from Wurzburg in Southern Germany; again, their arrival was incomplete when they came to America.

The HEPFER Coat of Arms dates back to the 1500s according to Wolfram HEPFER from Wurzburg, also doing research on the HEPFER family, whom the author was never able to make contact but did receive information from other sources.  He states that during the early 1800s two HEPFERs emigrated from Germany, one to Australia, and the other to America.  The Austrailian never married and no information was found on him.  The HEPFER who sailed to America was also never heard from again.
