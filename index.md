## Welcome to the Hepfer Family website

"Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation."  Joel 1:3

"One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare their mighty acts."  Psalms 145:4

Over the years, the late family historian and genealogist Dwane V. Norris compiled and published information in his book __"The Hepfer Family History, Germany to the U.S.A.__ in 1999 in honor of the 70th Reunion Anniversary (July 27, 1930).  This website attempts to provide some information from his publication, and also make available more recent information.
