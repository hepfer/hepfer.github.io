## Welcome to the Hepfer Family website

This site contains history and genealogical informatation of the Hepfer family.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation."*  Joel 1:3

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare their mighty acts."*  Psalms 145:4

Over the years the family historian and genealogist Dwane V. Norris compiled information about the family in his book __"The Hepfer Family History, Germany to the U.S.A.__, published in 1999 in honor of the 70th Reunion Anniversary (July 27, 1930).  

This website attempts to make available some of the information in his publication, and also provide more recent information.
