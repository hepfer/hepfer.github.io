## First Generation

Baden and the Kingdom of Wuerttemberg.  Each place then became a province of the Weimar Republic.  In 1945 when the Third Reich fell, baden and Wuerttemberg were combined to become a new State of Wuerttemberg. Later in 1952, when local leadership was allowed to take more control, the Land (State) was renamed Baden-Wuerttemberg.  The administrative districts began to change in 1924, when four Kreis system was dissolved.  In 1936, the "Oberamt" was replaced by the modern "Landkreis" (State District or New Countries). There are 65 of the latter named - 27 in Baden, 36 in Wuerttemberg.

Katharina Magdalena MERK was a Lutheran by faith.  Records at the Parish Archives in Kuppingen, Herrenberg in Wuerttemberg indicate the family residence, as well as the Family Register there.

To this union, one child was born.
